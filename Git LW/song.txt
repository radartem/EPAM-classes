DZ Deathrays Still No Change Lyrics

You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
You wanted a change out of this
But nothing’s right
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
It’s just the same old thing
It happens in time
Calling out there’s something that I’m holding on
Cough it up there’s something you won’t talk about
When the changes are all you ever focus on
It makes it hard to see what we’ve been working on
My sentiment
Keeps changing
I kinda feel the same now
 
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
You wanted a change out of this
But nothing’s right
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
It’s just the same old thing
It happens in time

 
And I know it’s all gone to the dogs
When the fear of unknown is your gripe
And I will let you know if it dies
But I feel it will keep me alive
 
Holding out
It always feels like the time is wrong
All in all I guess it’s just a little unresolved
When the changes are all I ever focus on
It makes it hard to see what we’ve been working on
My sentiment
Keeps changing
I kinda feel the same now
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
You wanted a change out of this
But nothing’s right
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
It’s just the same old thing
It happens in time
All we see is something better
Something worth it
Something wrong
You wanted a change out of this
But nothing right
